A quick and dirty guide on how to use AO3 skins :) by me

Using an AO3 skin is super mega easy! Just copy and paste (ctrl+a then crtl+c on PC, select all then copy on mobile) the CSS code in the box, then  move over to AO3.

While logged in, click or tap your account name up in the top right corner, then go to any option on the dropdown. On your right (PC) or along the top (mobile) click "Skins". At the top go to "create skite skin" and paste the CSS into the text box. Adjust the colours as you see fit, give your skin a name (this can be anything, but it will have to be unique. I recommend your username, a bunch of keysmash, or whatever else will help you remember what skin it is) then scroll to the bottom of the page and tap "submit".

You'll be met with the code you just put in the box laid out all nice. Scroll back to the bottom of the page for two options. "Use" will apply the skin and make all of AO3 look pretty nice if I do say so myself.

If you made any changes to the code, like altering colours or hidden stats, click "preview" instead to make sure things are looking good before committing. Once you're happy with everything, click "return to skin to use" and scroll all the way back down to find the "use" button. Click that sucker and you'll be good to go!
